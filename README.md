# RMP-Data-Scraper

While looking for RateMyProfessor Data online, I cam across a python library which purportedly allowed data scraping. However, when I actually worked iwth the code, I realized the library was broken and did not achieve it's purpose. After looking over the flaws in the code, I decided to completely rewrite the library code, preserving the original functionality and methodology. In the process, I got to learn how XML files work and how the tags can be used to get the data needed. This code here reflects the changes I have made.
